## Homework 3 - Visualization

### Part 1 - Due by 1:00 pm on Monday October 2nd.

Each team repository contains an excel spreadsheet (`xlsx` extension) in the `part_1` folder. Each spreadsheet contains data and a "bad" visualization of some or all of that data. Your task is to revise the existing visualization into something more useful that tells an interesting story about the give data. There is not one right answer but you should be able to justify your design choices. You are welcome to use any tool you would like for producing this visualization (e.g. R, R+ggplot2, excel, tableau, etc.)

Your work product for this part of the assignment should be a single page pdf or png file, in the `part_1` folder, containing your revised visualization. If you want to use an interactive visualization please supply a screenshot *and* a link to where the visualization can be accessed.

You should also be prepared to present on your design choices (2-3 mins) during class on Monday October 2nd.


### Part 2 - Due by 11:59 pm on Monday October 9th.
